This is a Task Manager Application that allows users to manage their tasks with different statuses (active/completed) and priorities. The app consists of a frontend built with React and a backend powered by Node.js and Express, with a MongoDB database to store user tasks.

Table of Contents:
Setup Instructions
Frontend:
Navigate to the frontend folder:
cd Frontend
npm install
npm start
The app will be available at http://localhost:.... 


Backend setup:
Navigate to the backend folder:
cd backend
npm install
Create a .env file in the backend folder with the following content:
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:....../taskmanager
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
PORT=..
npm start



Technical Choices & Architecture
This project uses a MERN stack:
MongoDB for the database.
Express.js as the backend framework.
React for the frontend.
Node.js as the runtime environment.
The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs, and JWT authentication is used to handle user login and session management.
The architecture follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for the backend, which keeps the business logic, routing, and database operations well separated.

Seed Data
## Seed Data ðŸŒ±

To test the application, follow these steps to create users and tasks:

1. **Create Users:**
   - You can create users by using the registration API or directly in the database.
   - Make sure to create secure passwords for the users.

   Example:
   - **User 1:**
     - Email: `user1@example.com`
     - Password: `your_secure_password_1`
   - **User 2:**
     - Email: `user2@example.com`
     - Password: `your_secure_password_2`



2. **Create Tasks:**
   - Tasks can be added via the front-end or through API endpoints.

   Example Tasks:
   - **Task 1:**
     - Title: "Finish project report"
     - Description: "Complete the final report for the task manager project."
     - Status: `incomplete`
     - Priority: `high`
     - Assigned to: User 1
     
   - **Task 2:**
     - Title: "Complete homework"
     - Description: "Finish the assigned homework for the course."
     - Status: `incomplete`
     - Priority: `medium`
     - Assigned to: User 2
